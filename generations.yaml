    description: "The Jeep Renegade is the brand's first subcompact SUV, developed as a global vehicle and built in Italy on the Small US Wide platform shared with the Fiat 500X. Despite its small dimensions, it features distinctive Jeep styling with a boxy profile, trapezoidal wheel arches, and the signature seven-slot grille. The X-shaped taillights are inspired by military jerry cans, while unique design elements like the 'X' motif headlights and optional My Sky removable roof panels reference Jeep heritage. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include small-displacement turbocharged engines, with North American models featuring a 1.4L or 2.4L four-cylinder engines paired with either a six-speed manual, dual-clutch automatic, or nine-speed automatic transmission. Available in front-wheel drive or with two different four-wheel drive systems, including Active Drive Low with a 20:1 crawl ratio on Trailhawk models that earn Jeep's 'Trail Rated' badge. The interior combines rugged Jeep design cues with modern technology, featuring numerous Easter eggs (hidden design elements) throughout the cabin. Advanced features include Uconnect infotainment systems with available navigation, plus driver assistance technologies like lane departure warning and forward collision warning. The Renegade has been sold in North American, European, Brazilian, South African, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese markets, built in Melfi (Italy), Goiana (Brazil), and Guangzhou (China)."

    description: "A significant facelift for the 2019 model year introduced revised front and rear bumpers, new LED headlamps inspired by the Wrangler, and a larger front grille. The infotainment system was upgraded with a more powerful processor and larger display (7\" to 8.4\"), now featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. In North America, the 1.3L GSE Turbo Multiair replaced the 1.4L Fire Turbo as the base engine, while the 2.4L Tigershark remained available. European models received new FireFly engine family options including a 1.0L turbocharged three-cylinder and an updated 1.3L turbo four-cylinder, along with improved diesel engines meeting Euro6D-Temp standards with SCR systems. The 2022 update standardized the U Connect 4C 8.4-inch touchscreen with integrated navigation and SiriusXM services across all models. For the US market, the 2.4L engine was discontinued in 2022, and the Sport trim was dropped for 2023, making AWD standard across the lineup. The Renegade was discontinued in the US and Canada after the 2023 model year, continuing production in Europe and Latin America."
