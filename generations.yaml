    description: "The Jeep Renegade is the brand's first subcompact SUV, developed as a global vehicle and built in Italy on the Small US Wide platform shared with the Fiat 500X. Despite its small dimensions, it features distinctive Jeep styling with a boxy profile, trapezoidal wheel arches, and the signature seven-slot grille. The X-shaped taillights are inspired by military jerry cans, while unique design elements like the 'X' motif headlights and optional My Sky removable roof panels reference Jeep heritage. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include small-displacement turbocharged engines, with North American models featuring a 1.3L turbocharged four-cylinder (replacing the original 1.4L and 2.4L engines) paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Available in front-wheel drive or with two different four-wheel drive systems, including Active Drive Low with a 20:1 crawl ratio on Trailhawk models that earn Jeep's 'Trail Rated' badge. The interior combines rugged Jeep design cues with modern technology, featuring numerous Easter eggs (hidden design elements) throughout the cabin. Advanced features include Uconnect infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, plus available driver assistance technologies like lane departure warning and forward collision warning. A significant refresh for 2019 updated the exterior styling, powertrains, and technology features, while a more modest update in 2022 brought further refinements to keep the model competitive. Despite its small size and car-based platform, the Trailhawk variant offers surprisingly good off-road capability with 8.7 inches of ground clearance, skid plates, tow hooks, and hill descent control. As Jeep's smallest model, the Renegade plays an important role in attracting first-time and urban buyers to the brand, offering Jeep's distinctive character and styling in a more city-friendly package that's sold in over 100 countries worldwide."
